## Abstract

Legacy phosphorus (P), corn (Zea Mays L.) hybrids, weather conditions and regulation on land-applied manure impact on site-specific mineral P requirements. Mineral P fertilizers are still banded at corn seeding as “insurance” policy even where manure P is applied in compliance with regulation in Eastern Canada. Our objective was to measure the effects of site-specific factors on the response of corn hybrids of the “new” era (1991+) to mineral and manure P fertilization under regulatory constraints. A data set of 413 corn P fertilizer trials conducted between 1991 and 2009 in Quebec, Canada, comprised trials using mineral P alone (259 trials) or in combination with manure (154 trials). Linear mixed models tested the effect of P fertilization on seedling biomass, grain yield, grain specific weight and grain moisture content as impacted by weather and soil indices. Early plant growth proved to be a misleading indicator of final crop performance. Where no manure was applied, grain yield and quality were impacted mainly by soil test P, pH, and gleyzation. There were unequivocal response to P additions only where (P/Al)Mehlich3 percentage was less than 5%. Mineral P fertilizers showed no significant effect on crop performance where manure was applied, but manured soil generally showed (P/Al)Mehlich3 percentages exceeding 5%. Banding mineral P at corn seeding where manure was applied at rates complying with the regulation and the (P/Al)Mehlich3 percentage exceeded  5% appeared to be a waste of resource under the soil and climate conditions of the 1991-2009 period in Eastern Canada.
